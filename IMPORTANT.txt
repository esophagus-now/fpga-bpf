I just spent about two whole days trying to figure out why the design works in 
the sim, but not in hardware. It turns out there was nothing wrong with my 
design, so to speak; the problem was that you need to set the base address 
properly (i.e. manually) inside the AirHDL core. The address editor won't do it 
for you.

TL;DR Remember to set the base address of the packet filter so that it matches 
the one in the address editor
