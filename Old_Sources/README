Not sure why I kept these, to be honest.

I guess the one benefit would be that you could always swap out parallel_packetfilts
for packetfilt and use the old version.

The only reason to do this is because you've found a bug in the new version, and
want a quick and dirty way to try the old version.

The new version has:
- Pipelining
- Parametric number of parallel packet filters
- Probably a bunch of small improvements here and there
- A few extra places where pessimistic registers are inserted
